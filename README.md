# Social Animals

By Marie Koscianski-Ducharlet, Hugo Rinc√© and Isabelle Yi, during our studies at [Ada Tech School](https://adatechschool.fr/)

## Project overview

During the first phase of this project, we were invited to refactor and complete a fill-in-the-gaps exercise using PHP and a provided MySQL database, in order to get familiar with the PHP/SQL syntax and connection. We then had 2,5 days to code our own social network structure if we felt like it. 

For this second phase, we chose to create from scratch Social Animals, a pets' social network where pets can post their cutest pictures, like other members' posts, follow users, and event attend events!

## Challenges

This was our very first project in PHP/SQL, as our previous Ada Tech School exercises and group projects had been only in JS.
We also had very little time to create a database and website from scratch once we had completed the first phase of the exercise. Some project groups chose to stick to the provided structure, refactor and redesign it. We felt we would better benefit from this project if we designed our own MySQL database and wrote the subsequent SQL requests.

We used TailwindCSS framework for the design.

In the end, this website is far from perfect but we learnt a lot during the process, and we're quite proud to have successfully implemented all the functions that we wanted to include!
